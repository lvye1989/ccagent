 * Single source of truth for the product version and outbound identity.

 * `__CCAGENT_VERSION__` is substituted at build time from `package.json`
 * (see `tsup.config.ts` → `define`), so the published bundle carries a literal.
 * The alternative — reading `package.json` at runtime — would require
 * `import.meta.url` for path resolution and force `package.json` into the
 * published tarball, both of which we deliberately avoid.
 *
 * Running from a checkout (`npm run dev` via tsx) has no define step, so the
 * `typeof` guard falls back to a dev marker. That is intentional: seeing
 * `0.0.0-dev` in a bug report immediately distinguishes "ran the source tree"
 * from "ran an installed release".
