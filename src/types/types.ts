/**
 * Skill type definitions.
 *
 * A "Skill" is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter describing a reusable
 * workflow. Compared to a Tool (TypeScript code), a Skill is a *declarative*
 * unit: prompt + permission config. The Skill body becomes a UserMessage at
 * invocation time, instructing the model how to perform a complex task.
 *
 * Stage 17 supports a subset of the source-code frontmatter fields. The full
 * field list (model/effort/context=fork/agent/hooks/shell/...) is parsed but
 * ignored for now — see DEVELOPMENT-PLAN §17.6.1 for the deferral rationale.
