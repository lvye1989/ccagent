 * the three-tier degradation the skills formatter has.
 *
 * The block goes into the dynamic section of the system prompt so the
 * model knows what `subagent_type` values it can pass to the Agent tool,
 * and — equally important — what the on-disk format is when the user
 * asks the model to define a brand-new sub-agent. Without that second
 * half, models tend to fall back to `.yaml` / `.json` from their training
 * data and the loader silently ignores the file.
