/**
 * SendMessage — drop a text message into a teammate's inbox.
 *
 * Reference: claude-code-source-code/src/tools/SendMessageTool/SendMessageTool.ts
 *
 * Stage 21 implements only the plain-text path of source's tool:
 *   - `to: "<name>"`  — write to one teammate's inbox
 *   - `to: "*"`       — broadcast to every active teammate (skip self)
 *
 * Skipped vs source:
 *   - Structured messages: shutdown_request / shutdown_response /
 *     plan_approval_response. These require either the in-process
 *     subagent-task layer to wire abort signals back into the running
 *     teammate's loop (source) or a separate shutdown protocol. Stage
 *     21 keeps shutdown handling implicit (`run_in_background` agent
 *     naturally terminates; TeamDelete waits for `isActive=false`).
 *   - UDS / bridge cross-machine routing.
 *   - SendMessage-to-stopped-agent auto-resume (source's
 *     `resumeAgentBackground`). CCAGENT's async sub-agents are not
 *     resumable today (stage 20 §20.3 deferred).
 *
 * Identity: who is "from"? Two paths converge here:
 *
 *   1. The team LEAD calls SendMessage — `from = TEAM_LEAD_NAME`.
 *   2. A TEAMMATE calls SendMessage — `from = <teammate's name>`.
 *
 * Path 2 needs the teammate's identity. We thread it through the
 * `ToolContext.teammateIdentity` field that AgentTool sets on the
 * sub-agent's enriched tool context. When the field is absent we
 * default to TEAM_LEAD_NAME — the symmetric assumption that any tool
 * call without a teammate identity is coming from the lead's session.
