/**
 * TeamCreate — kick off an Agent Teams session.
 *
 * Reference: claude-code-source-code/src/tools/TeamCreateTool/TeamCreateTool.ts
 *
 * Mental model: TeamCreate is the moment the main session morphs from
 * "one agent talking to the user" into "team lead coordinating
 * teammates". After this call:
 *
 *   - `~/.ccagent/teams/<sanitized>/team.json` exists with the lead
 *     as the sole member.
 *   - The in-process `teamContext` singleton is populated; promptInjection
 *     starts including team-coordination guidance in the system prompt.
 *   - SendMessage / TeamDelete become operative.
 *   - The model can now call `Agent({ name, team_name, ... })` to
 *     spawn named teammates that the lead can SendMessage to.
 *
 * Trimmed vs source:
 *   - No `getResolvedTeammateMode()` / tmux backend setup — CCAGENT
 *     only does in-process teammates (background sub-agents).
 *   - No analytics event.
 *   - No `parseUserSpecifiedModel` resolution; we record the lead's
 *     current model name as-is.
 *   - No shared-tasks-dir reset (source's `Team = Project = TaskList`
 *     coupling). Stage 15's task store is per-session already; we keep
 *     the same `getTaskListId(sessionId)` semantics inside teammates.
 *
 * Gating: this tool's `isEnabled()` returns false unless
 * `isAgentTeamsEnabled()` (the feature flag) is true. When teams are
 * off, the model never sees the schema and never calls it.
