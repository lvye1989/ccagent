/**
 * TeamDelete — disband the active Agent Teams session.
 *
 * Reference: claude-code-source-code/src/tools/TeamDeleteTool/TeamDeleteTool.ts
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. Refuse if no team is active (no-op error so the model doesn't
 *      retry blindly).
 *   2. Refuse if any non-lead teammate is still `isActive: true` —
 *      mirrors source's `activeMembers.length > 0` check. The model is
 *      instructed to message the teammates first (or wait for them to
 *      finish) before deleting the team. Stage 21 does not implement
 *      the shutdown_request protocol, so the model handles cleanup
 *      manually.
 *   3. Best-effort `removeAgentWorktree` for each teammate that left
 *      uncommitted changes in an isolated worktree.
 *   4. `rm -rf ~/.ccagent/teams/<sanitized>/` — atomically removes
 *      the team file, every inbox, and any leftover lock files.
 *   5. Clear the in-process teamContext singleton.
 *
 * What we omit vs source:
 *   - Analytics event.
 *   - Color-assignment registry cleanup (we don't track teammate colors).
 *   - tmux pane / orphan-process cleanup (no tmux backend).
 *   - `clearLeaderTeamName()` (we don't share the task-list-id namespace
 *     between lead and teammates; each teammate has its own session id).
