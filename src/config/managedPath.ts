/**
 * Resolves the path to a machine-wide managed settings file.
 *
 * This is the highest-priority configuration source — intended for managed
 * deployments where an administrator pins settings outside any single user's
 * control. Only a single local file is consulted here; richer managed-config
 * backends (remote sync, OS policy stores) are reserved extension points and
 * not wired up.
 *
 * Paths follow the platform conventions for system-wide application data:
 *   macOS   → /Library/Application Support/CCAgent/managed-settings.json
 *   Linux   → /etc/ccagent/managed-settings.json
 *   Windows → %PROGRAMDATA%\CCAgent\managed-settings.json
