/**
 * Machine-level State store (`~/.ccagent/state.json`).
 *
 * This is the second of CCAGENT's two configuration systems. Unlike
 * settings.json (shareable, version-controllable configuration), the State
 * store holds per-machine runtime + security state that must never be
 * committed to a repository — most importantly, which project directories
 * the user has marked as trusted.
 *
 * Why trust lives HERE and not in a project's settings.json:
 *   If trust were recorded inside the project directory, a hostile repository
 *   could ship a settings file that pre-marks itself as trusted, defeating the
 *   whole point of the trust prompt. Trust is therefore a property the user's
 *   own machine remembers ABOUT a directory, keyed by the directory's
 *   canonical identity.
 *
 * Project key:
 *   - inside a git repo → the canonical repo root (so every subdirectory of a
 *     trusted repo inherits trust, and worktrees of the same repo agree).
 *   - otherwise         → the absolute cwd.
 *   Keys are normalized to forward slashes for cross-platform stability.
 *
 * Durability:
 *   Writes go through a temp file + atomic rename so a crash mid-write can
 *   never leave a half-written, unparseable state file. A bad/missing file is
 *   treated as empty state (fail-soft) — losing trust state is annoying, not
 *   dangerous (the user just gets re-prompted).
