/**
 * In-process active-team registry (stage 21).
 *
 * Mirrors source's `AppState.teamContext` slice — a single object that
 * encodes "this CCAGENT process is currently leading team X". The
 * constraint of one team per process is intentional and source-aligned
 * (TeamCreate refuses while a teamContext is set).
 *
 * The team metadata itself lives on disk (TeamFile, see
 * utils/teamHelpers.ts). This module is the in-memory cache that lets
 * tools — SendMessage, AgentTool, the QueryEngine inbox poller —
 * answer "what team am I in?" without a disk read per call.
 *
 * Why a module-level singleton:
 *   The team lead IS the main session. Wiring this through AppState
 *   would force every tool to thread state through ToolContext (which
 *   stage 8 deliberately kept small). A module-level Map mirrors the
 *   shape we use for asyncAgentStore / todoStore / etc.
