/**
 * Output Styles registry (stage 23).
 *
 * An "output style" is an extra block of system-prompt text that reshapes
 * HOW the agent answers (tone, structure, teaching behaviour) without
 * changing WHAT tools it has. Three styles ship built-in:
 *
 *   - default      : no extra prompt (the agent behaves as designed).
 *   - Explanatory  : the agent adds short "Insight" teaching blocks.
 *   - Learning     : the agent pauses and asks the user to write small
 *                    pieces of code (TODO(human) hand-off).
 *
 * Users can add their own under:
 *   ~/.ccagent/output-styles/<name>.md        (user scope)
 *   <cwd>/.ccagent/output-styles/<name>.md    (project scope, wins)
 *
 * The active style is a single piece of process-global state, flipped at
 * runtime with `/output-style <name>` and persisted to settings.json as
 * `outputStyle`. `buildSystemPrompt` reads `getActiveOutputStyleConfig()`
 * each turn so a switch takes effect on the very next request.
 *
 * Reference: claude-code-source-code/src/constants/outputStyles.ts
 *   - We mirror `OUTPUT_STYLE_CONFIG` + `keepCodingInstructions`.
 *   - We DROP plugin/managed scopes and the forced-plugin logic.

## Requesting Human Contributions
To encourage learning, ask the human to contribute 2-10 line code pieces when generating 20+ lines involving design decisions, business logic with multiple valid approaches, or key algorithms.

- You must first add a single \`TODO(human)\` section into the codebase with your editing tools before making the request.
- Make sure there is one and only one \`TODO(human)\` section in the code.
- After the request, stop and wait for the human to implement it before proceeding.

### Request Format
\`\`\`
• Learn by Doing
Context: [what's built and why this decision matters]
Your Task: [specific function/section, mention the file and TODO(human)]
Guidance: [trade-offs and constraints to consider]
