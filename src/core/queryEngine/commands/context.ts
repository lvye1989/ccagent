/**
 * CommandContext — the narrow seam between the QueryEngine and its extracted
 * slash-command handlers.
 *
 * Each `/command` handler used to be a private method on QueryEngine, reaching
 * directly into `this.*`. To split them into their own modules without breaking
 * encapsulation (and without exposing the engine's private fields), handlers
 * now receive a `CommandContext`: a minimal, read-/write-through view of just
 * the engine state they actually touch.
 *
 * QueryEngine builds one of these (see `QueryEngine.commandContext()`) and
 * passes it to each handler. The interface grows member-by-member as more
 * command groups are extracted — only add what a handler genuinely needs.
