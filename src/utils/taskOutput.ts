/**
 * Task-output file helpers for background sub-agents (stage 20).
 *
 * The model gets back `outputFile: <absolute path>` from a launched
 * background `Agent(...)` call. While the sub-agent runs in the
 * background, every interesting event (text chunk emitted by the model,
 * tool_use_start, tool_use_done with truncated result, completion / error)
 * is appended as a JSON-Lines record to that file. The main agent can
 * `Read` or `Bash tail` it to peek at progress at any time, and the
 * `<task-notification>` injected on completion also references the same
 * path.
 *
 * Path convention (mirrors source's `{projectTmp}/{session}/tasks/{id}.output`,
 * adapted to our `~/.ccagent/projects/...` layout):
 *
 *   ~/.ccagent/projects/<sessionId-encoded>/tasks/<agentId>.output
 *
 * Why JSONL and not a plain narrative log:
 *   - One event per line — `tail` and `Read offset` work cleanly.
 *   - Structured (timestamp + type + payload) — when we later add a
 *     dedicated UI viewer it can parse the file without regex hacks.
 *   - Resilient to partial writes: if the process crashes mid-line, the
 *     partial line is the *last* line and consumers can drop it.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - Writes are best-effort. We never let an output-file IO error bubble
 *     up to crash the sub-agent loop — the worst case is the user sees an
 *     empty .output file but the result still comes back via the
 *     notification (which is how the source behaves too).
 *   - We append in a single `fs.appendFile` per event (no buffering).
 *     Perf is fine — sub-agents emit O(turns) events, not O(stream tokens).
 *   - Path is derived purely from sessionId + agentId; both are pure
 *     strings, no Date.now() races, so two callers with the same inputs
 *     end up writing to the same file (intentional — that's how the
 *     parent's Read can find it).
