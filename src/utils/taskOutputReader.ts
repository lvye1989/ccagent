/**
 * Read + parse the JSONL `.output` file that background sub-agents
 * append to during their run. Used by the teammate transcript viewer
 * (stage 21) — when the user enters viewing mode the UI calls
 * `readTaskOutputEvents` to render what's there, then sets up a polling
 * loop via `useTaskOutputLive` for incremental updates.
 *
 * Why polling and not fs.watch:
 *   - fs.watch is unreliable on macOS for tail-style growth (often
 *     fires once for the inode change but not for subsequent appends).
 *   - The .output file grows at ~1 event per tool call, i.e. seconds
 *     apart. A 1s polling interval is more than fast enough and uses
 *     a single stat() per tick.
 *   - The viewer is only mounted while the user is actively looking
 *     at one teammate — total cost is negligible.
 *
 * Robustness:
 *   - Files may not exist yet when the viewer mounts (the agent might
 *     have just been launched and not written its first event). We
 *     return [] for ENOENT and let the caller render an "initializing"
 *     placeholder; the polling loop will catch the first event.
 *   - Partial last lines (process crashed mid-write) are dropped
 *     instead of throwing — JSONL is designed for this.
 *   - Each event already carries a `timestamp` field (added by
 *     `appendTaskOutput`), so no need for line numbers as a poor-man
 *     ordering key.
