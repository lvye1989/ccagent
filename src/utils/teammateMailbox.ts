/**
 * Teammate mailbox — file-locked, JSON-array inbox per team member.
 *
 * Reference: claude-code-source-code/src/utils/teammateMailbox.ts
 *
 * Why file-based and not in-memory:
 *
 *   1. Symmetry. A teammate that runs in the background is reachable from
 *      anywhere — the lead's main loop, another teammate's
 *      `SendMessage`, even a future tmux backend. An on-disk inbox is
 *      the lowest-common-denominator channel that doesn't care which
 *      process or which thread put the message there.
 *   2. Durability across resumes. Source supports `--resume` on
 *      teammates and the inbox file survives the gap. We don't ship
 *      teammate resume in stage 21, but keeping the same on-disk shape
 *      means we don't have to re-architect when we add it.
 *   3. Reusing proper-lockfile we already brought in for taskStore.
 *      Source uses the same library for the same job.
 *
 * On-disk shape: a single JSON file per teammate at
 * `~/.ccagent/teams/<team>/inboxes/<name>.json`, containing an array
 * of TeammateMessage records. Read = parse, write = lock + append +
 * write. The lock file lives next to the inbox file with a `.lock`
 * suffix (proper-lockfile's default convention).
 *
 * Concurrency contract:
 *   - Multiple writers (e.g. two teammates SendMessage'ing the same
 *     recipient in the same tick) are serialized by the per-file lock.
 *     proper-lockfile retries with backoff for up to ~2.6s; the second
 *     writer waits, then sees the first writer's append and appends
 *     after it.
 *   - Readers are unsynchronized (atomic read of a JSON array file).
 *     Mid-write corruption is impossible because writers always rewrite
 *     the FULL file atomically via fs.writeFile (write + rename under
 *     the hood); a reader catches either the pre- or post-write content.
 *
 * What we explicitly skip vs source (the source file is 1200 lines):
 *   - Structured protocol messages (shutdown_request / plan_approval /
 *     sandbox_permission_request / team_permission_update). The
 *     teaching version only handles plain text messages.
 *   - Idle / permission-request notification helpers; those rely on
 *     polling layers we don't ship.
 *   - markMessagesAsReadByPredicate / readUnreadMessages /
 *     getLastPeerDmSummary etc. — kept the minimum: read-all,
 *     write-one, mark-all-read.
