 *   ├── team.json              ← TeamFile (this file's read/write helpers)

 *
 * One team per process is the source-aligned constraint — `TeamCreate`
 * refuses to spawn a second team while one is active. That keeps the
 * mental model simple ("I'm leading exactly one team right now") and
 * spares us from cross-team routing logic in SendMessage.
 *
 * What this file does NOT do — and intentionally so:
 *   - tmux pane id / backendType tracking (source-only, no terminal mux here)
 *   - hidden pane registry, member mode broadcasting
 *   - cross-machine plan_approval / shutdown protocols
 *   - registerTeamForSessionCleanup (source uses it for SIGINT cleanup;
 *     we rely on the existing graceful-shutdown path + best-effort
 *     `cleanupTeamDirectories` from TeamDelete instead).

//
//   1. The only writers are the team lead's process (CCAGENT is
//      single-process — no tmux teammates), and
//   2. The lead's writes happen serially inside one event loop turn
//      (AgentTool launches a teammate → registers them; nothing
//      concurrent races us).
//
// Source uses async file writes with no lock here for the same reason.
