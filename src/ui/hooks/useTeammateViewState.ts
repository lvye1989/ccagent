/**
 * useTeammateViewState — React adapter for `teammateViewStore`.
 *
 * Two things bundled together:
 *
 * 1. Live subscription — components that want to re-render whenever the
 *    view mode / selection changes use the returned `view` snapshot.
 *
 * 2. Auto-exit — when the user is currently viewing or has selected an
 *    agent that just disappeared / finished, we want to drop them back
 *    to the main view automatically (otherwise the screen stays on a
 *    stale transcript that won't grow further). Mirrors source's
 *    `useTeammateViewAutoExit` (claude-code-source-code/src/hooks).
 *
 *    Auto-exit policy (matches source):
 *      - `viewing` mode + agent no longer running AND no longer in
 *        store at all → eject. (Users keep viewing completed teammates
 *        while the entry still exists, so they can read the final
 *        transcript at their leisure.)
 *      - `selecting` mode + selected agent no longer running → bump
 *        cursor to the next running one, or close picker if none left.
