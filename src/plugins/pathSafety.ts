/**
 * Component-path containment checks (plan §35.5).
 *
 * A plugin manifest can declare component paths (skills/agents/commands/...)
 * and a Git-sourced plugin is untrusted code on disk. Before the loader reads
 * any of those paths we must prove they still resolve INSIDE the plugin root —
 * a `..`, an absolute path, or a symlink that escapes the root would otherwise
 * let a hostile plugin read arbitrary files (or trick the loader into loading
 * an agent/hook from outside its sandbox).
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   1. Lexical — `resolve()` the candidate against the root and confirm the
 *      result is still prefixed by the root. Catches `..` and absolute paths.
 *   2. Realpath — resolve symlinks on BOTH the root and the candidate and
 *      re-check containment. Catches a symlink inside the plugin that points
 *      outside it.
 *
 * The Zod schema already rejects literal `..` / absolute paths in the manifest
 * string; this module is the defense-in-depth that also survives symlinks and
 * is reused for auto-discovered default directories.
