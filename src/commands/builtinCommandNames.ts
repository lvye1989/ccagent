 * The set of slash-command names handled INTERNALLY by the QueryEngine

 * command or skill with one of these names must NOT shadow the built-in,
 * otherwise `/help`, `/output-style`, etc. would silently stop working
 * once a user drops a same-named file into ~/.ccagent/commands/.
 *
 * Both the engine (when deciding whether a `/x` is a user command) and the
 * UI (when deciding whether `/x` should trigger the LLM) consult this set,
 * so the two layers agree on dispatch.
