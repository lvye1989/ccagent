/**
 * Process preflight — runs before anything else in the binary.
 *
 * This module does its work as an *import side effect* and must stay the first
 * import of the entrypoint. ESM evaluates imports in source order, so anything
 * here happens before the module bodies of later imports. That ordering is the
 * whole point: both concerns below are worthless if some other module already
 * crashed or already produced an unreadable stack trace.
 *
 * 1. Node version gate. `engines` in package.json is advisory — under npm's
 *    default config it prints a warning and installs anyway. So the real gate
 *    has to live inside the binary, and it has to produce a sentence a user can
 *    act on rather than a `SyntaxError` from deep inside a dependency.
 *
 * 2. Source maps. The published bundle ships a `.map` next to it, but Node
 *    ignores source maps unless asked. Without this call the shipped map is
 *    dead weight and every reported stack trace points at bundled line numbers.
