/**
 * Lightweight bash compound-command splitter.
 *
 * Why we need this: the auto-allow path checks each subcommand of
 * `echo a && rm -rf /` against deny rules. If we matched only the head
 * of the full command string, `Bash(rm:*)` would not catch the second
 * subcommand and the deny rule would silently fail. See the SECURITY
 * comment in source code's `bashPermissions.ts:1295`.
 *
 * Compared to source code's `splitCommand_DEPRECATED` (which uses
 * `shell-quote` to do real parsing including redirects, heredocs, and
 * parameter substitution), our version is intentionally minimal:
 *
 *   - We split on the four standard logical operators: `&&`, `||`,
 *     `;`, `|` and the `&` background operator.
 *   - We respect single + double quotes — `echo "a && b"` is one
 *     subcommand, not three.
 *   - We do NOT understand subshells `(...)`, command substitution
 *     `$(...)`, heredocs `<<EOF`, or escapes inside double quotes.
 *
 * For the ccagent threat model this is enough: even if a model
 * crafts an exotic command that tricks the splitter, the worst case
 * is "we run one extra deny-check" or "we miss a deny rule on a
 * cleverly-quoted subcommand" — and the sandbox itself still
 * enforces the kernel-level filesystem/network restrictions.
