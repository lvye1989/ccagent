/**
 * Detect whether the sandbox can actually run on the current host.
 *
 * Why this exists (security footgun, mirroring source code's
 * `getSandboxUnavailableReason`):
 *
 *   The user opts in by writing `sandbox.enabled: true` in settings.json.
 *   If the host can't run sandbox-exec — e.g. they're on Windows or
 *   Linux, or sandbox-exec was removed by some MDM tool — and we
 *   silently fall back to "no sandbox", the user thinks they're
 *   protected and they aren't. So we surface the reason loudly at
 *   startup and let the user decide.
 *
 * CCAGENT only ships the macOS backend (see DEVELOPMENT-PLAN
 * stage 18.6). Linux/WSL is explicitly out of scope for the tutorial.
