/**
 * Ship one self-contained ESM file.
 *
 * The published package declares no runtime `dependencies` — everything is
 * inlined here. That is only safe because the tree passes the three checks in
 * DEVELOPMENT-PLAN §36.0: no path introspection (`import.meta.url` /
 * `__dirname`) in `src/`, no native `.node` modules on the runtime path, and no
 * external runtime assets (`yoga-layout` inlines its wasm as base64 JS).
 *
 * Intentional trade-offs, not oversights:
 *   - `minify: false` — for a project whose source is the product, a readable
 *     stack trace in a bug report beats a smaller file.
 *   - `format: "esm"` — the codebase is `type: module`, and a CJS downlevel
 *     would break `import.meta` semantics if assets are ever added.
 *   - `define` for the version — see src/version.ts for why we never read
 *     package.json at runtime.
